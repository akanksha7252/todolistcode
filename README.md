Hello,

Key Features:-

Task Creation: Users can add new tasks and mark them as complete or incomplete using a checkbox.
Task Display: The task list is displayed after successfully adding task records.
Task Management: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete after theyâ€™ve been created.
Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks directly from the task list screen.
Task Details: Users can view task details by clicking on a task.
Clear Task List: The entire task list can be cleared using the pencil square icon located below the welcome message.

Additionally, I included a text field for the first name, allowing for a personalized greeting (e.g., "Welcome, Tushar"), which enhances the user interface. This field is totally optional; you can choose to enter your name or skip it if you prefer.
